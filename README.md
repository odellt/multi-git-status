mgitstatus
==========

Show uncommited, untracked and unpushed changes in multiple Git
repositories.  Scan for .git dirs up to **DEPTH** directories deep.
The default is 2.  If **DEPTH** is 0, the scan is infinitely deep.

mgitstatus shows:

* **Uncommitted changes** if there are unstaged or uncommitted changes on the
  checked out branch.
* **Untracked files** if there are untracked files which are not ignored.
* **Needs push (BRANCH)** if the branch is tracking a (remote) branch which is
  behind.
* **Needs upstream (BRANCH)** if a branch does not have a local or remote
  upstream branch configured. Changes in the branch may otherwise never be
  pushed or merged.
* **Needs pull (BRANCH)** if the branch is tracking a (remote) branch which is
  ahead. This requires that the local git repo already knows about the remote
  changes (i.e. you've done a `fetch`), or that you specify the `-f` option.
  mgitstatus does NOT contact the remote by default.
* **X stashes** if there are stashes.

Since there are a lot of different states a git repository can be in,
mgitstatus makes no guarantees that *all* states are taken into account.

mgitstatus can also list dirs that are not a repo, if given the `-w`
switch. To ignore certain repos, set the `mgitstatus.ignore` git config flag
for that repo to `true`. (See "usage" below for an example).


# Usage

    Usage: mgitstatus [--version] [-w] [-e] [-f] [--no-X] [DIR] [DEPTH=2]

    Scan for .git dirs under DIR and show git status. The scan goes 2
    directories deep by default or the number specified by DEPTH deep.
    If DEPTH=0, the scan is infinitely deep.

      --version   Show version
      -w          Warn about dirs that are not Git repositories
      -e          Exclude repos that are 'ok'
      -f          Do a 'git fetch' on each repo (slow for many repos)
      -c          Force color output (preserve colors when using pipes)

    You can limit output with the following options:

      --no-push
      --no-pull
      --no-upstream
      --no-uncommitted
      --no-untracked
      --no-stashes

The following example scans all directories under the current dir, with a
depth of 2. That means the current dir and all directories directly under it.

    ~/Projects/fboender $ mgitstatus 
    ./mgitstatus: ok 
    ./mdpreview: ok 
    ./snippets: ok 
    ./boxes: ok 
    ./ansible-cmdb: Uncommitted changes Untracked files 
    ./scriptform: Uncommitted changes 

To scan deeper (three dirs instead of two) in the current dir:

    ~/Projects $ mgitstatus . 3
    ./megacorp/ansible: ok 
    ./megacorp/monitoring: ok 
    ./fboender/mgitstatus: ok 
    ./fboender/mdpreview: ok 
    ./fboender/snippets: ok 
    ./fboender/boxes: ok 
    ./fboender/ansible-cmdb: Uncommitted changes Untracked files 
    ./fboender/scriptform: Uncommitted changes 
    ./fboender/startpage: ok 

The following command scans three levels deep in `/opt/deploy/` and hides
repos that are 'ok'. It does not show stashes:

    $ mgitstatus -e --no-stashes /opt/deploy 3

To ignore a repo, set the `mgitstatus.ignore` git configuration option for
that repo to `true`. E.g.:

    $ cd stupidrepo
    $ git config --local mgitstatus.ignore true

# Installation

mgitstatus requires a POSIX compliant shell. Bash will do fine.

1. Clone this git repo
2. Copy `mgitstatus` somewhere in your PATH

Or follow these instructions:

    $ curl -s -o mgitstatus https://raw.githubusercontent.com/odellt/multi-git-status/master/mgitstatus
    $ chmod 755 mgitstatus
    $ sudo mv mgitstatus /usr/local/bin/
